## Materials:
  - Primary Labelling Buffer (see [Protocol](https://github.com/astormic/Antibody_Dye_Conjugation/tree/main))
  - Secondary Labelling Buffer (see [Protocol](https://github.com/astormic/Antibody_Dye_Conjugation/tree/main))
  - Unlablled primary antibody
  - Phosphate buffered saline (PBS)

## Methods:
### Primary labelling
1. Take 2mL of cells from the flask
2. Centrifuge to 50 µL (200G for 2 min) 1x
3. Pour off the wash buffer into a waste container.
4. Put in primary labelling buffer (1:100). Probably around 0.5 µL. 
5. Leave it in the fridge for 30 min.
6. Wash out the primary using 1 mL PBS
7. Centrifuge to 50 µL (200G for 2 min) 2x

### Secondary labelling
1. Take 2mL of cells from the flask
2. Centrifuge to 50 µL (200G for 2 min) 1x
3. Pour off the wash buffer into a waste container.
4. Put in unlablled primary buffer (1:100). Probably around 0.5 µL. 
5. Leave it in the fridge for 30 min.
6. Wash out the primary using 1 mL PBS.
8. Centrifuge to 50 µL (200G for 2 min) 1x
9. Put in secondary labelling buffer (1:100). Probably around 0.5 µL.
10. Leave it in the fridge for 30 min.
11. Wash out using 1 mL PBS
7. Centrifuge to 50 µL (200G for 2 min) 2x
